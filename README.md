## Important

It is important to note that you must install Google Chromedriver and Google Chrome and the versions must be compatible. Example: If Google Chrome is version 80, then Google Chromedriver must be version 80.

Many times web scraper programs can work incorrectly or not work when there are changes in the HTML structure.
If this is the case, you can send me an email so that I can modify the script or you can create a branch and then make a pull request.
